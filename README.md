This project is about implementation for tram Tracking inside Mahidol University. <br>
It applies the concept of Internet of Things. We use the following hardware e.g. ESP32, RFID-RC522, GPS Shield Duinopeak, and GPS Antenna. <br>
We also developed a mobile application using React to display information about tram usage in form of a map. <br>
